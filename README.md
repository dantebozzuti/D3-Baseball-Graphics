# D3 Baseball Graphics
I developed this application to provide interactive statistics, team rankings, and customizable data visualizations to NCAA Division 3 baseball players and fans. Additionally, I wanted to improve upon my R programming skills and prepare myself for a possible career in Data Science. As a Division 3 baseball player myself, I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and my R programming knowledge greatly improved.
