# D3 Baseball Graphics
I developed this application to provide interactive statistics, team rankings, and customizable data visualizations to NCAA Division 3 baseball players and fans. Additionally, I wanted to improve upon my R programming skills and prepare myself for a possible career in Data Science. As a Division 3 baseball player myself, I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and my R programming knowledge greatly advanced.

## Repository Guide
To start, I would recommend checking out the [web app](https://wickmanb22.shinyapps.io/D3_Baseball_Graphics_v2/) to get an understanding of the different elements of the project. The Rankings folder details how I made the D3 RPI Rankings table. The Player Stats folder walks through how I made the 'Batting Statistics' and 'Pitching Statistics' tables. The Visualizations folder gives the code that I use to construct the plots. Lastly, the Web App Design folder details the code I used to design the application in R Shiny. 

### Technology
Project is created with:
* R 4.0.0 for Windows
